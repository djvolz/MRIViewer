# MRIViewer

This project was a demo application to help display 3D images.  

3D images were generated by an MRI scan and then compared with a follow up MRI scan using
a 3D SIFT algorithm (developed and maintained by bbrister: https://github.com/bbrister/SIFT3D).

The 3D SIFT outputted a 3D image which needed a way of visualizing the matches found, hence this app.

This project is not actively maintained and is essentially a simple 3D image slice viewer. You are welcome
to use the code however you want.
